Welcome to the **React JavaScript Workshop** hosted by GDG-PUP Web Development!

This workshop is designed to introduce you to the world of React.js, one of the most powerful and widely-used JavaScript libraries for building interactive user interfaces. Whether you’re just starting with JavaScript or already have experience, this study jam will help you gain hands-on experience with React concepts and practical skills to build modern web applications.

### 🚀 Why This Workshop is Necessary

React.js is the foundation for many modern web applications, and mastering it is essential for front-end developers. This study jam provides a structured approach to learning React through practical assignments and projects. By completing the assignments, you'll build a strong understanding of React's core concepts, such as state management, props, and effects. The project will tie everything together by giving you the chance to create a fully-functional application—a note-taking app—applying your newly acquired skills.

| No. | Topic                                | Description                                                                                                                                               |
| --- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Increment Decrement Counter          | Learn the basics of `useState` by building a simple counter with both increment and decrement functionality. This demonstrates state management.          |
| 2   | Props using Boxes                    | Explore how to pass and manage props in React by creating boxes that represent modular components. This will help in understanding component reusability. |
| 3   | Fetching API with `useEffect`        | Learn how to fetch data from an API and display it in a component using `useEffect`. This will give you insight into side-effects in React.               |
| 4   | Conditional Rendering based on Place | Learn how to use conditional rendering to display different components based on certain conditions or "places" in your app.                               |

## 🚀 Project Assignment: Note-Taking App

### Project Overview

The final project will be a **Note-Taking App**, where you will apply everything learned throughout the assignments. In this app, users can create, edit, and delete notes, and the state of the app will be managed efficiently using React's state and effect hooks.

### Skills Practice

- **State Management**: Using `useState` to manage the state of the app.
- **Props**: Passing data between components using props.
- **Side Effects**: Using `useEffect` to fetch and store data.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Displaying content dynamically based on state or user interaction.
