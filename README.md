Welcome to the **React JavaScript Workshop** hosted by GDG-PUP Web Development!

This workshop is designed to introduce you to the world of React.js, one of the most powerful and widely-used JavaScript libraries for building interactive user interfaces. Whether you‚Äôre just starting with JavaScript or already have experience, this study jam will help you gain hands-on experience with React concepts and practical skills to build modern web applications.

### üöÄ Why This Workshop is Necessary

React.js is the foundation for many modern web applications, and mastering it is essential for front-end developers. This study jam provides a structured approach to learning React through practical assignments and projects. By completing the assignments, you'll build a strong understanding of React's core concepts, such as state management, props, and effects. The project will tie everything together by giving you the chance to create a fully-functional application‚Äîa note-taking app‚Äîapplying your newly acquired skills.

### üëÄ What's Inside It

This repository contains the following **main** folders:

1. **Assignments folder**: A collection of exercises designed to solidify your understanding of React concepts.
2. **Project folder**: The main project that you will build as part of this workshop.

| No. | Topic                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Increment-Decrement Counter**         | Build a simple counter application to understand state management in React using `useState`. Create buttons to increment and decrement the counter value. Display the current count on the screen. **Bonus:** Add logic to prevent negative numbers by conditionally disabling the decrement button or displaying a warning. This introduces conditional rendering and basic logic handling in React.                                           |
| 2   | **Top 3 Major Projects Using Props**    | Create a parent component that holds information about your top 3 project ideas for 2025. Pass the project details (title and description) as props to child components. Dynamically render each project inside the child components. This exercise helps in understanding how to pass data between components and maintain modular, reusable structures in React.                                                                              |
| 3   | **Fetching User Data with `useEffect`** | Fetch and display user information from the API: [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users). Use `useEffect` to make the API call when the component is mounted. Store the fetched data using `useState` and dynamically render a list displaying each user's name and email. **Bonus:** Implement error handling to show an error message if the API request fails or data is not fetched.       |
| 4   | **Conditional Rendering: My Address**   | Create a component that fetches your address from [https://psgc.cloud/api](https://psgc.cloud/api). Use `useEffect` to fetch the data and `useState` to store it. Render the address only when it has been successfully retrieved. **Bonus:** Add error handling to display a message if the API call fails and show a loading spinner while the data is being fetched. This exercise demonstrates the power of conditional rendering in React. |
